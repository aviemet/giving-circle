# REQUIRED FOR EVERY INTERACTION

1. Read .cursor/giving_circle.mdx at the start of each interaction
2. Before ending ANY response, if you've learned anything useful which is NOT immediately obvious from reading the code about:
   - **Why** decisions were made (rationale, trade-offs, historical context)
   - **Non-obvious** implementation details or gotchas
   - **Cross-cutting concerns** that affect multiple parts of the system
   - **Performance implications** or optimization strategies
   - **Security considerations** or authorization patterns
   - **Integration points** with external systems
   - **Deployment or environment-specific** configurations
   - **Known limitations** or edge cases
   You MUST update .cursor/giving_circle.mdx with this information
3. When updating .cursor/giving_circle.mdx:
   - Only add new information not already documented
   - Place information in the appropriate section
   - If no appropriate section exists, create one
   - DO NOT document what the code obviously does (e.g., "routes are defined in routes.rb")
   - DO NOT document standard Rails/React patterns that are self-explanatory
   - DO NOT document parameter names or method signatures that are clear from the code
   - DO NOT document file organization that's obvious from the directory structure
4. After updating .cursor/giving_circle.mdx, explicitly note in your response what new information was added
